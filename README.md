Instructions

Write a program where the user can play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) against the computer. The winner is determined by the first player to win two rounds.

Requirements

The user is playing against a computer opponent in Rock, Paper, Scissors.
A game consists of a series of rounds until either player has won.
The first player to win two rounds is declared the winner and the game ends.
The number of rounds won by the player and the computer are shown each round.
Output the winner of the game before exiting.
The computer opponent randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors each round.
The user chooses their shape by typing "r" (rock), "p" (paper), or "s" (scissors) each round.
If the player enters an invalid shape, print an error message and start the next round.
If both players choose the same shape, it is a tie and no one wins the round.

Tips

Use your submission for the first Rock Paper Scissors challenge as a starting point.
Incorporate your knowledge of looping, iteration, flow-control, and data structures to make the required changes.
